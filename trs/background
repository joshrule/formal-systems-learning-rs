# For any string rewriting problem, we assume:
CAT(END z_) = z_;
CAT((x_ y_) z_) = (x_ CAT(y_ z_));

# NOTE: THESE ASSUMPTIONS WERE REMOVED TO SIMPLIFY EVALUATION
# # 1. Strings are associative.
# x_ y_ z_ = x_ (y_ z_);
# x_ (y_ z_) = x_ y_ z_;
#
# 2. Rewrites can insert or remove the empty string, e, as needed.
# x_ y_  = x_ e y_;
# x_ e = x_;
